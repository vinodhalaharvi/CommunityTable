![CommunityTable is an open source project organized by the Community Tables initiative. It is a technical expression of a much more essential human drive to support _neighbors helping neighbors_._Far Vision: The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/community_tables_landing.png "Title and Far Vision")

## Stakeholders
We have identified 3 stakeholders which drive our initiatives. We are building Community Tables products to be easily customized by any local community organizer -- captured by the term _localized_. Our initial efforts are grounded by Michelle, the Founder of Community Table TN. Michelle is our first customer and viewed as our primary stakeholder during this initial product increment. The other two stakeholders are composites of known neighbors in need and community members, respectively. Persona template adapted from [orangebus](http://orangebus.co.uk/insights/the-power-of-proto-personas).

Here are more in-depth profiles of our [Stakeholder Personas](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/stakeholders.md).

## Product Iteration (OCT-DEC 2016)
* __Name:__ Community Cloud Tables

## Product Backlog
Community Tables current product backlog is available to our Scrum Team members and management at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/i9TmhPfB/final-project-community-table)

Reference our [Team Formation Sprint](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md) for our Definition of Ready, Definition of Done, User Story Sizing approach, and starting Product Backlog snapshot. 

### Rationale for Backlog Order
The backlog is ordered by value generated to our stakeholders, namely Community Table TN (the first customer for our open source products). We (as well as our key stakeholder) are starting from scratch (levering other open source software frameworks where feasible). PBIs are groomed to represent excellent users stories within our team's [Definition of Ready](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/sprint0.md#definition-of-ready) and have been estimated by the development team.
